		In this exercise, we were tasked with evaluating the user interface and functionality of both the OSX Catalina Scientific Calculator and the Windows 10 Scientific Calculator, as shown in the screenshots above. Our goal was to assess their design, operation, and usability.
        After a thorough evaluation, I have reached several conclusions. While these calculators have distinct designs, they share similar core functionalities and purposes. They are generally user-friendly, particularly for individuals already familiar with scientific calculators.
        During my personal testing of both calculators, I noticed that they offer essentially the same capabilities. However, there is a notable difference in convenience between the two. Windows 10 Scientific Calculator stands out for its history feature, conveniently displaying previous calculations at the top. This can be especially beneficial for users prone to forgetting their inputs.
        On the other hand, the OSX Catalina Scientific Calculator is more intuitive and accessible in terms of layout. All functions and buttons are readily visible on the screen, simplifying navigation. In contrast, the Windows calculator requires users to click buttons to access additional functions, which may pose a slight learning curve.
        Furthermore, the Windows calculator excels in error recovery due to its history bar and memory tab. These features make it easier for users to correct mistakes and retrieve past calculations. Additionally, the presence of clearly labeled buttons on the Windows calculator can be advantageous for individuals less familiar with scientific calculators.
        In summary, both calculators serve their purpose effectively, but they cater to different preferences. Windows 10's calculator emphasizes history and convenience, while OSX Catalina's calculator prioritizes an accessible and straightforward layout. The choice between them may depend on individual user needs and familiarity with scientific calculator functionality.
