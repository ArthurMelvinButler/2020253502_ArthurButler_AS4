    <p>
        This is my final year and So far, HCI has been one of the better classes where the teacher has made it interesting for us. The lectures and resources have proven to be useful thus far. For this exercise, we’ve been tasked to comment on the past assignments.

        <ul>
            <li>What did you like about this HW? The idea of redesigning a website sounded ideal, but realizing I couldn’t made me aware of what I need to work on. </li>
            <li>What did you not like about this HW? However, when it came to trying to actually redesign the website, I couldn’t. Additionally, I do wish we could’ve gotten the critique from our peers. Lastly, the instructions were a bit vague. I recall classmates messaging me about what exactly we needed to do, and i realized that I didn't exactly know either. </li>
            <li>What was difficult? I had trouble redesigning the website and shifting or editing the shopping app.</li>
			<li>How long did you spend on it? I spent about 1-2 days on this assignment. </li>
			<li>Now that you've finished it, what did you learn? I learned that I need to take some time to learn about redesigning. In addition to this, I learned that CSS plays a huge role in making a page or interface allow a user to feel welcomed. </li>
        </ul>
